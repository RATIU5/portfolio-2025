## The Details

After learning the basics of Go, I created this simple CLI tool to help me sort images by their creation date. This tool was created to help me organize lots of photos on my computer into easy-to-find folders by reading the image metadata. I'm sure improvements can be made, but I learned a lot more about Go by creating this tool.
