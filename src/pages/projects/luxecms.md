## The Details

This is by far my most abitious project to date. If you've not already read my [introduction blog post](/blog/new-cms), I'd recommend you do so now. It outlines the goals and motivations behind this project.

Some of the goals of this project are to create a CMS that is:

- **Fast**: The admin panel should be fast and responsive, and the CMS should be able to handle a large number of requests per second through the API.
- **Easy to use**: The CMS "shouldn't need a manual", but we'll provide one anyways. It should be easy to use, and the admin panel should be intuitive.
- **Customizable**: The CMS should be customizable through code. From the admin panel to the database schemas.
- **Modular**: Modularity is the key here. Each part can be plugged in or out, and the CMS can be extended with plugins.
- **Open Source**: The CMS will be fully open source and free to use. It is licensed under the MIT license.

Feel free to view the progress on GitHub. The project is still in its early stages, but I'm working on it most days when I have free time, as this is a hobby project and I have a full time job. I'm excited to see where it goes.
