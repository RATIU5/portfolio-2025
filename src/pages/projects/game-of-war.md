## The Details

When working for a local technical college, I was put in charge of developing a final for students to complete after learning the JavaScript language. I wanted to create something that was fun and engaging for students, while also pushing them to think critically about the language. I decided to create a simple game of War.

This first attempt was actually written in TypeScript and I learned a lot about the language while creating this game. It features fancy animations, a simple UI, and a lot of fun.
