## The Details

This project was my first time using the Go programming language to create a CLI tool. TheBoiler is is a simple CLI tool that stores and manages project boilerplates and templates for any coding project you're working on. It uses boltdb to store the directory structure and file contents of the boilerplate. I'm not in a position at the moment to continue working on this project, but I'm happy with the progress I made and the things I learned while working on it.
