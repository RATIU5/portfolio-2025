## The Details

When working for a local technical college, I created this tool that would convert Markdown content into beautiful stylized HTML that was compatible with the Canvas learning platform. The goal was to create a tool that would allow instructors to easily create content for their courses without having to learn HTML or CSS. The tool was designed to be simple and easy to use.

Features include:

- Markdown to HTML conversion
- Live preview of the content
- Export to HTML code
- Simple interface
