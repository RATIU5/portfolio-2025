## The Details

During my time at univeristy, we learned a lot about the C++ language. One of the most memorable projects we worked on was a recreation of the game Asteroids by Atari. Under the hood, it uses a custom graphics layer over GLUT, which is a library that allows for OpenGL rendering.

The game features a ship that can rotate and thrust in any direction, as well as shoot bullets. The asteroids are generated randomly and move in random directions. The game ends when the player's ship collides with an asteroid. The game also features a score system that increases as the player destroys asteroids. The game is controlled using the arrow keys to rotate and thrust the ship, and the space bar to shoot bullets. A new feature I added was aliens that moved toward the users location. The game is a fun and challenging project that showcases my skills in C++ and OpenGL.
