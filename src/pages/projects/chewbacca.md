## The Details

This was a fun project to build. It's a simple web server written in Go that scrapes a website for dead or 404 assets and returns a list of them. I created this as a way to easily find errors on websites that my team and I were working on. It's a simple tool but it's been very useful. Lots of improvements can be made but it's not a priority to me right now.
